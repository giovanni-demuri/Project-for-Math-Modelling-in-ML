# Project for Math Modelling in ML
This project was done for the course in Math Modelling for Machine Learning, a second year course of BAI. The goal was to compare the performance of Random Forest and Logistic Regression for classification, on a given dataset. 
The repository contains:
- `data`: a folder containing the data that was given.
- `main.html`: a .html file of a jupyter notebook containing all the analysis that was done on the data
- `mldata_0003164501.description.txt`: a .txt file containing the description and the goal of the project
- `output_test.txt`: a .txt file containing the prediction of the labels for the test data that was given.
